# Pixelflood

A short desciptions of how to use it.

This project was initially created to interact with the GPN20 Pixelflood server.
Further development is done during 38c3 to implement gamepad control of the image placement as we want to have a more interactive experience with Pixelflood.

Server settings have to be adjusted in the code.

Usage:

python3 main.py <<name of .png>>
The script uses the generic gamepad input from the inputs python package.
